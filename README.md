## ✅ Upgraded from .NET 5 to .NET 9
- Used **.NET Upgrade Assistant** to migrate the project from .NET 5 to the latest .NET 9.
- Updated NuGet packages to ensure compatibility with .NET 9.

---

## 🐳 Added Docker Support
- Created a **Dockerfile** to containerize the application.
- Built and ran the Docker image locally using:
  ```bash
  docker build -t hotelsapi .
  docker run -d -p 5000:80 hotelsapi


* Access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## 🧪 Unit Testing with xUnit

* Created a separate **Unit Test project** within the solution.
* Used **xUnit** for writing and running unit tests.
* Verified that the API logic behaves as expected.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

* Deployed the Dockerized .NET 9 Web API to **Render/Railway/Azure** (choose the one you used).
* Ensured successful deployment and tested with Postman.
* Got a live URL (for example: `https://hotels-web-api-service.onrender.com/api/hotels`).
